## Project Status

This project is currently under **limited active development** due to my focus on other projects.

It is not abandoned and will continue to receive essential maintenance when necessary.  
Contributions, issues, and pull requests are welcome.

## 👋 Introduction

Welcome to my **Learning Repository**.

This repository is not a random collection of tutorial codes or unfinished experiments.  
It is a **structured, intentional, and long-term learning archive** where I design, build, break, refactor, and rebuild software systems to deepen my understanding of real-world engineering.

I use this repository to **think like a professional engineer**, not just to “learn syntax”.

## 🎯 Purpose & Vision

The core goals of this repository are:

- 📌 Transform theoretical knowledge into **practical engineering skills**
- 📌 Practice **production-ready architecture**, even in small projects
- 📌 Build muscle memory for clean code and scalable structures
- 📌 Explore technologies deeply instead of superficially
- 📌 Track my growth as a Full‑Stack Developer over time

> This repository is about **depth over speed**,  
> **understanding over copying**,  
> and **engineering over tutorials**.

## 🧠 Engineering Mindset

Every project in this repository follows a simple but strict rule:

> **“If this were a real product, how should it be built?”**

That means I actively think about:
- Code structure and folder hierarchy
- Separation of concerns
- Reusability and extensibility
- Naming conventions
- Error handling and edge cases
- Security basics
- Performance considerations
- Maintainability in the long term

Even when a project is small, I intentionally **over‑engineer** parts of it to learn how systems behave at scale.
